    wm-aop RESTful API provides the ability to define mocks within webMethods Integration Server.  Note that where _paths_ are shown, they should be prepended with the base path, eg, when looking at /define/advice the actual path you call is /rest/org/wmaop/define/advice
    
    Being familiar with [wm-jbehave stories](https://github.com/wmaop/wm-jbehave/wiki/Syntax-for-creating-JBehave-stories) helps to identify use cases and ways to use the API.
    
    Note that the examples show responses when the _Accept:_ header is set with _text/xml_.   Setting with _application/json_ is similarly valid where suitable for your tooling.  Without the _Accept:_ header you may receive a default response of html.
    
    This documentation is auto-generated from the [Swagger definition of the API](https://github.com/wmaop/wm-aop/blob/master/src/docs/swagger/swagger_wmaop.yaml)

        Specify the adviceId to see details of that advice or leave the adviceId null for all registered advices.   Returned values is an IData record structure. 
        #### Example
        If we register a simple mock, such as that shown in define fixedResponse, then with
        ````
        GET http://localhost:5555/rest/org/wmaop/define/advice/myMockingId
        ````
        we receive the response of:

  /define/assertion/{adviceId}:
    get:
      summary: "Get simplified details of an assertion (Or indeed any advice...)"
      description: |
        Retrieves simplified details of the assertion to allow easy check of the number of times the assertion was invoked when its condition matched (Ie, pipeline state matched the condition applied or pure invokation count where no condition occurs).
        
        The assertion (And mock) lookup uses the adviceId as a prefix rather than an exact match. This allows a combined count for mocks or assertions where they begin with the id.  So, mocks with adviceId's of _adviceMock1_ and _adviceMock2_ count have their counts tallied by looking up _adviceMock_.  For example, you may have one of multiple services called, checking the prefix allows a single test to for an invoke count of 1 to prove that one was invoked.  
        #### Example
        Making a request for the assertion name of _myMockingId_:
        ````
        GET http://localhost:5555/rest/org/wmaop/define/assertion/myAssertion
        ````
        Gives the response of:
        ````
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <Values version="2.0">
            <value name="adviceId">myAssertion</value>
            <number name="invokeCount" type="Integer">0</number>
        </Values>
        ````
        Note that all registered advices are _assertable_ and as such you can specify any {adviceId} to retrieve its invoke count, e.g. ````GET http://localhost:5555/rest/org/wmaop/define/assertion/myMockingId```` to see an invoke count of the simple mock defined elsewhere here.

      - name: "adviceId"

        description: "The ID of the assertion or any other advice"

      summary: "Create an assertion"
      description: |
        Firing mocks and testing pipeline values might be enough to satisfy you that the test has worked, but sometimes its useful to know that a particular service has been invoked and how many times (Eg, if the service has iterated some data, did it action the correct number?). Its also useful to know if a service has produced the expected output but it might not be possible to check the eventual pipeline contents due to values being dropped, etc.
        
        Using Assertions allows you to 'peek' at the pipeline and check that something has happend. Just like mocks, assertions can have conditions applied to them so that the assertion only registers as invoked if the condition is met.
        
        Note that you only need assertions when checking flow through a service, usually before or after a particular service of interest is invoked. If you want to check that your mocks have fired, use a GET /define/assertion/{adviceId} on a mock for a summary of its invokation count
        #### Example
        Creating an assertion called _postAddingNumbersAssertion_ which is invoked _after_ the _serviceName_ of _pub.math:addInts is called and the pipeline _condition_ is that the _value_ in the pipeline is 9.   Note that the URL is fully URL encoded to escape the spaces, colons and equals symbols.  Failure to correctly encode the URL will lead to incorrect behaviour.

        Testing of behaviour should include negative paths where exceptional circumstances need handling and exeception handling requires execution. Instead of a service executing, its possible to raise an exception instead thereby simulating a failure.
